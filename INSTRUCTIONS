SPACECAT (v1.1) Instructions
January 6, 2017

The objective is to reach the gate, which appears as a purple,
rectangular portal.

Move the cat around with the arrow keys
    LEFT: Move left
    RIGHT: Move Right
    UP: Jump
    DOWN: Crouch

SPACEBAR: Paw swipe. Can use this to attack cannons when close.
Press q to return to the home screen at any time.
Press r to restart a given level.

Tip: crouching while in the air allows the cat to lift its feet a bit higher,
and reach platforms otherwise unreachable, if well timed.

There are three types of platforms, hardbottom, softbottom, and spike.
The cat can jump through softbottom platforms from below, but not hardbottom.
Spikes cause you to lose a life for every frame you are touching them.

Cannons will shoot at the cat from any distance when he enters their
line of sight; from one projectile hit, you will lose one life.
Remaining lives are displayed in the top left.

Begin playing by executing "cabal run" from the spacecat directory.
Close the game/window with the escape key.

Good luck out there!

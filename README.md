# SPACECAT

![spacecat_example](http://jdbrady.info/files/spacecat.gif)

SPACECAT is a precision platform game written in Haskell, which involves navigating our hero, the spacecat, to the exit portal.
Uses Haskell gloss package for animation and 2D rendering.
Written with I. McInerney as our Functional Programming course final project, though I put more work into cleaning it up and
adding features after the course for a v1.1 release.
SPACECAT gameplay requires both precisely timed keypresses and more restful thinking to master MAP II. Use MAP I to practice
and learn the controls.
